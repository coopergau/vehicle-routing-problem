Vehicle Routing Problem

## Dependencies
- **Catch2** (testing)
- **OpenMP** (parallel computing)

### WSL Installation
sudo apt install libsfml-dev

## To Do
 - add tests (revert)
 - try with the depot in random location
 - add parellel to tests
 - add comparisons between algos
 - compare with the same locations
 - clean up clarke wright tests

 - add errors for invalid function params (and test)
 - put the distance in the animation (python) make the genetic solver return the final distance (its good that the solver returns the distance but for every step in the animation takes longer so that can be just in python)
 - consider how to handle progress printing
 - clean #includes and comments
